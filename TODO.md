### Status Rules

#### Task Status
- `[ ]` = NOT STARTED
- `[/]` = IN PROGRESS  
- `[x]` = COMPLETE

#### Current Phase Rule
The current phase is the earliest phase containing an incomplete VXC task. A phase becomes COMPLETE only when ALL VXC tasks inside that phase are marked `[x]`.

#### Current Task Rule
The current task is the VXC task actively being implemented and marked `[/]`. Only ONE VXC task should normally be marked `[/]` at a time unless there is a genuine dependency reason.

#### Next Task Rule
The next task is determined from the existing dependency order in TODO.md. Do NOT invent a new task order. Respect all existing VXC dependencies.

## Project Identity

**VoxCode — Agentic Java RAG Code Intelligence**

VoxCode is an Agentic Java RAG intelligence system that investigates Java/Spring repositories using AST, dependency analysis and hybrid retrieval, produces evidence-backed engineering plans, performs human-approved bounded code changes, and verifies or rolls back those changes.

**Core Principle:**
Understand → Retrieve → Investigate → Prove → Plan → Act → Verify

**Core Thesis:**
"Understand before changing, prove before acting, and verify after acting."

**Architectural Flow:**
Repository → Repository Intelligence (AST + Dependency Graph + Repository Index) → Hybrid Repository-Aware RAG → One Adaptive Primary Agent → Evidence Engine → Finding Validation → Engineering Plan → Human Approval → Bounded Remediation → MCP/Tool Interface → Isolated Docker Workspace → Build + Tests + Static Analysis + Diff/Scope Validation → PASS (Accept) / FAIL (Bounded Repair) / FAIL after retry budget (Rollback) → Engineering Report → Evaluation

**Technology Scope (LOCKED):**

**TIER 1 — PRIMARY IDENTITY**
- **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot, Maven
- **Agentic AI:** Spring AI, one adaptive primary agent, tool calling, structured agent state, persisted decision/engineering traces
- **Repository Intelligence:** JavaParser for AST/program structure, JGraphT for dependency relationships, Repository Index for unified querying
- **Evidence Engine:** Structured evidence model, finding validation

**TIER 2 — MAJOR AI SUBSYSTEM**
- **RAG:** Embeddings, Qdrant, hybrid retrieval (vector + lexical + metadata/symbol + dependency-aware), reranking, context assembly, agentic retrieval, RAG evaluation and ablation

**TIER 3 — CONTROLLED ENGINEERING ACTION**
- **Remediation:** OpenRewrite for deterministic Java/Spring transformations where appropriate, AST-aware transformation, AI-generated targeted patches only when deterministic transformation is insufficient
- **Execution:** Docker sandbox, controlled build/test execution, resource limits, restricted filesystem/network access
- **Verification:** Build, tests, static analysis, diff validation, bounded repair, rollback
- **Planning:** Engineering planning, human approval

**TIER 4 — SUPPORTING PRODUCT INFRASTRUCTURE**
- **Database:** MySQL for application state (repositories, investigations, agent traces, findings, evidence, plans, approvals, executions, verification results, evaluation results) - treated as supporting infrastructure, NOT a major project focus
- **Security:** Spring Security, authentication/authorization, repository isolation, path traversal protection, secret filtering, prompt-injection defenses, unsafe command protection
- **Frontend:** React with SSE for agent status streaming
- **CI/CD:** Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Pull Requests, branch protection, automated quality gates
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers

**TIER 5 — OPTIONAL / ONLY IF TIME REMAINS**
- **MCP:** Focused MCP server/interface exposing only useful VoxCode capabilities/tools (repository inspection, AST analysis, dependency analysis, retrieval, build, test, verification) - NOT a separate architecture or ecosystem

**EXCLUDED TECHNOLOGIES**
- Redis, Kafka, Kubernetes, Microservices, Distributed service architecture, Complex caching, Complex messaging infrastructure, Custom distributed workflow engines, Huge MCP ecosystem, Multi-agent swarm architecture, Foundation-model training, Custom LLM, Generic multi-language support, Full IDE replacement, Unlimited autonomous coding, Complex voice infrastructure, Arbitrary feature generation

## Project Rules
- **Scope Protection:** VoxCode is a one-year bounded project. No feature creep. No multi-agent architecture (one primary agent only), no general-purpose coding assistants, no graph RAG, Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, microservices, distributed service architecture, complex caching, complex messaging infrastructure, custom distributed workflow engines, huge MCP ecosystem, foundation-model training, custom LLM, generic multi-language support, full IDE replacement, unlimited autonomous coding, complex voice infrastructure, or arbitrary feature generation without absolute justification.
- **Primary Capabilities:** Investigation and Bounded Remediation are EQUAL, first-class capabilities. Investigation discovers, analyzes and proves repository problems. Remediation applies targeted fixes to confirmed findings.
- **Governing Principle:** Evidence and verification govern remediation. The LLM must NEVER be treated as the source of truth. No remediation is accepted without evidence and verification.
- **Not a Feature Generator:** VoxCode applies safe, targeted fixes for confirmed findings. It does NOT generate arbitrary application features (e.g., "Build an authentication system"). Requests for new features must explicitly be classified as OUT OF SCOPE.
- **Evidence Over Generation:** LLM reasoning must always be supported by deterministic repository intelligence (AST, Graph) and executable verification. RAG must NOT replace AST or graph analysis for structural claims.
- **Agent Traces:** The agent must leave a clear persisted decision trace for investigation (Request → Classification → Hypothesis → Tool → Observation → Evidence → Decision → Finding) and remediation (Finding → Plan → Approval → Transformation → Diff → Verification → Repair → Accept/Rollback). Do NOT expose hidden chain-of-thought.
- **Human Approval:** No code modification may occur without explicit human approval of an engineering plan. Investigation and read-only analysis may occur before approval.
- **Verification Criteria:** A generated patch is NEVER considered successful merely because it looks correct or builds. Remediation is successful ONLY when: intended files were modified, no unauthorized files were modified, diff matches approved plan, project builds successfully, tests pass, static analysis passes, and no unexpected modifications are detected. 
- **Rollback:** Failed remediation must be recoverable through automated rollback. Rollback triggers: verification permanently fails, repair budget is exhausted, unauthorized modifications detected, or remediation violates the approved scope.
- **Database as Supporting Infrastructure:** MySQL/JPA/Hibernate are supporting infrastructure for Agentic AI state persistence, NOT a major project focus. No complex database optimization, advanced SQL engineering, database sharding, complicated caching architecture, or unnecessary database abstractions.
- **MCP as Focused Tool Interface:** MCP is a focused interoperability boundary for selected VoxCode tools (repository inspection, AST analysis, dependency analysis, retrieval, build, test, verification). Do NOT create multiple MCP servers, MCP microservices, dozens of MCP tools, or an MCP ecosystem.
- **Technology Priority Rule:** Every technology must have a clear role in Retrieve → Investigate → Decide → Act → Verify → Evaluate. If a technology does not strengthen this loop, it should NOT be added.

## Remediation Scope
**Supported Scope (IN SCOPE):**
- Localized bug fixes
- Security fixes using existing infrastructure (e.g., missing `@PreAuthorize`)
- Incorrect annotations/configuration
- Deprecated API migrations
- Incorrect method calls
- Transaction-boundary fixes
- Dependency/configuration corrections
- Other small, single-concern, few-file fixes

**Unsupported Scope (OUT OF SCOPE):**
- Creating entire new application features
- Building authentication infrastructure from scratch
- Building new payment systems
- Creating large new modules
- Arbitrary application generation
- Unrestricted autonomous coding

## User Request Classification
Before investigation or remediation begins, VoxCode must classify every developer request as exactly one of:
- `INVESTIGATE`: The user wants explanation/investigation only. Stops after report.
- `REMEDIATE`: The user identifies a specific issue and wants a bounded fix. May skip discovery, but MUST still validate and create a CONFIRMED finding before remediation.
- `INVESTIGATE_AND_REMEDIATE`: The user wants VoxCode to investigate and then fix it. Follows complete lifecycle.
- `OUT_OF_SCOPE`: Requires arbitrary feature generation, large-scale dev, or unrestricted coding. Must be explicitly rejected. Stops after classification.

## Architecture Invariants
- **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot, Maven, Spring Security. Modular monolith structure.
- **AI/LLM:** Spring AI, semantic embeddings, Qdrant for vector storage. ONE primary adaptive agent/orchestrator.
- **Intelligence:** JavaParser (AST), JGraphT (Dependency Graph), Repository Index. RAG is for semantic context, not structural truth.
- **RAG:** Hybrid retrieval (vector + lexical + metadata/symbol + dependency-aware), reranking, context assembly. NOT just chunk→embed→top-K.
- **Execution:** Docker-based isolated workspaces for code modification, build, and tests.
- **Frontend:** React-based dashboard (Near-black + Neon green aesthetic).
- **Database:** MySQL for application state (investigations, traces, findings, plans, approvals, reports).
- **MCP:** Focused tool interface for interoperability, NOT a separate architecture or ecosystem.

## Definition of Done
Every task is only "Done" when:
- Code is implemented according to the locked architectural pattern.
- The feature is fully tested (Unit and/or Integration tests).
- Automated CI pipeline passes successfully.
- For AI features, deterministic fallback and error handling are present.
- Any architectural decisions are documented in an ADR.

- Update finding statuses (`CONFIRMED`, `REJECTED`, `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`).

Deliverables:
- Validation layer for findings.

## Phase 15 — Engineering Planning

### [ ] VXC-140 — Plan Generation
Priority: P0
Phase: 15
Dependencies: VXC-130

Goal:
Create a human-readable, actionable remediation plan from a finding that explicitly connects investigation to remediation.

Tasks:
- Implement `PlanGenerationService`.
- Ensure the plan is ALWAYS generated from a `CONFIRMED` finding, NEVER directly from an arbitrary user request.

- Persist the `EngineeringPlan` to the database.

Deliverables:
- Structured Engineering Plan generation and persistence.

Goal:
Prevent any code modification without explicit user consent.

Tasks:
- Implement API endpoints to review, approve, or reject an `EngineeringPlan`.
- Create the `Approval` entity linking the user, plan, and timestamp.

- Block the remediation pipeline if ANY of these conditions fail.

Deliverables:
- Approval workflow API and state enforcement.

Definition of Done:
- Remediation attempts fail immediately with an authorization error if the linked plan is not explicitly approved, or if the repository context does not match.

Tests:

---

## Phase 17 — Bounded Remediation

### [ ] VXC-160 — Safe Code Modification
Priority: P0
Phase: 17
Dependencies: VXC-150

Goal:
Apply approved fixes safely as a core, first-class product capability.

Tasks:
- Implement `RemediationService` capable of applying changes.
- Prioritize transformations in this exact order:
  1. Deterministic transformation using OpenRewrite when appropriate for Java/Spring transformations
  2. AST-aware transformation
  3. AI-generated targeted patch only when deterministic transformation is insufficient
- Never use unrestricted LLM text replacement as the default mechanism.
- Every modification MUST: operate only inside the approved workspace, remain within approved files/scope, produce a diff, preserve unrelated code, and be traceable to the plan.
- The remediation engine must detect unexpected modifications. If the actual diff contains files or changes outside the approved scope -> FAIL, do NOT accept, ROLLBACK.
- Persist the remediation trace (Finding → Plan → Approval → Transformation → Diff → Verification → Repair → Accept/Rollback).

Deliverables:
- Service that modifies repository files securely and outputs unified diffs.

Definition of Done:
- The service can successfully inject a `@PreAuthorize` annotation into a specific controller method using AST modification, outputting a clear diff. Scope violations are rejected and rolled back.

Tests:
- AST transformation tests; AI patch application tests; Scope violation tests.

CI:
- Included.

## Phase 18 — Docker Sandbox

### [ ] VXC-170 — Isolated Workspace Execution
Priority: P0
Phase: 18
Dependencies: VXC-160

Goal:
Run the modified code in a secure, isolated environment before accepting it.

Tasks:
- Integrate Docker Engine API (e.g., via docker-java).
- Implement logic to spin up a temporary container (JDK + Maven), copy the modified workspace, and prepare for execution.
- Set strict resource limits (timeout, memory, CPU/resource limits, restricted filesystem access, controlled network access).

Deliverables:
- `ExecutionSandboxService`.

Definition of Done:
- VoxCode can spawn a container, safely copy the codebase, execute `java -version` inside it under strict resource limits, and destroy the container.

Tests:
- Sandbox integration tests checking limits and execution.

CI:
- Requires Docker-in-Docker or Testcontainers in CI.

---

## Phase 19 — Build/Test/Static Verification

### [ ] VXC-180 — Executable Verification
Priority: P0
Phase: 19
Dependencies: VXC-170

Goal:
Verify that the remediation actually works. Remediation is only successful when ALL gates pass.

Tasks:
- Execute `mvn clean verify` (or compile + test) inside the Docker sandbox.
- Capture stdout, stderr, exit codes, and test result XMLs.
- Determine final status. Remediation succeeds ONLY if ALL required verification gates pass:
  1. Intended files were modified.
  2. No unauthorized files were modified.
  3. Actual diff matches the approved Engineering Plan.
  4. Project compilation/build succeeds.
  5. Tests pass.
  6. Required static analysis passes.
  7. No unexpected repository modifications exist.

Deliverables:
- Verification pipeline.

Definition of Done:
- Only passing all 7 gates results in ACCEPTED. A change that builds but modifies an unauthorized file results in FAILED.

Tests:
- End-to-end tests running against broken and fixed Java fixtures, including scope violation attempts.

CI:
- Included.

---

## Phase 20 — Limited Repair

### [ ] VXC-190 — Bounded Repair Loop
Priority: P1
Phase: 20
Dependencies: VXC-180

Goal:
Attempt to fix small verification errors without infinite looping.

Tasks:
- Parse verification failures (compiler errors, failing tests). Classify the failure.
- Provide ONLY relevant failure evidence back to the Agent to propose a targeted fix.
- Apply the correction ONLY within the approved scope.
- Re-run verification.
- Enforce a strict retry budget (maximum 2 attempts).
- The repair mechanism MUST NOT expand the scope of the original Engineering Plan. If a repair requires a new file or scope expansion → STOP, ROLLBACK.

Deliverables:
- Repair loop logic in the execution orchestrator.

Definition of Done:
- The system attempts to fix a minor compilation error, succeeds on retry, and stops attempting if it requires a new file or fails 2 times.

Tests:
- Mocked LLM tests to verify the retry counter and scope-expansion rejection.

CI:
- Included.

---

## Phase 21 — Rollback

### [ ] VXC-200 — State Preservation and Recovery
Priority: P0
Phase: 21
Dependencies: VXC-190

Goal:
Ensure failed remediations don't corrupt the repository.

Tasks:
- Take a Git snapshot or copy the workspace before remediation begins.
- Automatically restore the snapshot if ANY of the following occur:
  - Verification permanently fails
  - Repair budget is exhausted
  - Unauthorized modifications are detected
  - Remediation violates the approved scope
- Verify restoration.
- Record the rollback action in the execution history and mark remediation as `ROLLED_BACK`.

Deliverables:
- `RollbackService`.

Definition of Done:
- A failed verification with no remaining retries results in the workspace being completely restored, verified, and recorded.

Tests:
- File system assertion tests verifying rollback triggers and execution.

CI:
- Included.

---

## Phase 22 — Engineering Report

### [ ] VXC-210 — Report Generation
Priority: P0
Phase: 22
Dependencies: VXC-200

Goal:
Provide a comprehensive summary of the entire lifecycle covering BOTH traces.

Tasks:
- Aggregate the full Investigation trace (Request → ... → Finding) and the full Remediation trace (Finding → ... → Accept/Rollback).
- Generate a structured JSON (and markdown) Engineering Report containing both traces.

Deliverables:
- `ReportGenerationService`.

Definition of Done:
- The user can retrieve a single document containing the complete lifecycle traces from request to final verified status or rollback.

Tests:
- Unit tests verifying aggregation logic.

CI:
- Included.

---

## Phase 23 — Observability

### [ ] VXC-220 — Telemetry and Metrics
Priority: P1
Phase: 23
Dependencies: VXC-210

Goal:
Make the agent and system inspectable and measurable.

Tasks:

Definition of Done:
- Observability tools can track the average time spent in the Verification phase.

Tests:
- N/A

CI:
- N/A

---

## Phase 24 — Security Hardening

### [ ] VXC-230 — System Security Hardening
Priority: P0
Phase: 24
Dependencies: VXC-001

Goal:
Protect the system and repositories. Treat repositories as untrusted input.

Tasks:
- Implement JWT/OAuth authentication for the API.
- Ensure strict authorization (users can only access their own repositories).
- Protect against path traversal, malicious repository content, prompt injection from repository files, secret leakage, unauthorized access/modification, and unsafe command execution.
- Implement secret redaction for context sent to the LLM (e.g., filter out API keys; never send secrets into the LLM context).

Deliverables:
- Hardened Spring Security configuration, sanitizers, and prompt-injection defense.

Definition of Done:
- An API request to read a file outside the workspace (`../../etc/passwd`) is blocked. LLM context strips `.env` secrets.

Tests:
- Security unit tests, prompt injection tests, and path traversal attempts.

CI:
- Included.

Tasks:
- Build IDE-like explorer for displaying engineering plans, approvals, proposed diffs, applied diffs, verification status, repair attempts, rollbacks, and the final engineering report.
- Visualize Repair and Rollback states securely via SSE.
- Do NOT turn VoxCode into a full IDE replacement (IntelliJ/VS Code). Keep it focused on the remediation flow.

---

## Cross-Cutting Requirements

### Testing
- Maintain a clear separation between unit tests (fast, mocked LLM) and integration tests (Docker, DB, Qdrant, real LLM).
- Use real Java/Spring fixture repositories for intelligence and remediation testing.

### Security
- Repositories are untrusted input. Prevent prompt injection from repository documentation. Never send secrets to the LLM.
- Execution workspaces must be heavily sandboxed (Docker constraints on timeout, memory, CPU, FS, and network).

### Observability
- Keep agent traces persisted in the DB for debugging and visualization.
- Ensure the UI streams agent status via SSE so the user never sees a stalled "Working..." state.

### Documentation
- Maintain ADRs for major decisions (e.g., "Why we used JavaParser over regex", "Why we don't use GraphRAG").

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions enforces quality gates (Unit, Integration, Static Analysis checks).
- Protect `main` and `develop` branches via branch protection rules.
- All PRs must pass required CI checks before merging.
- See "Cross-Cutting Requirements — Professional Git & GitHub Development Workflow" for complete workflow details.

### MCP Integration
- MCP is a focused tool interface for interoperability, NOT a separate architecture or ecosystem.
- Implement only useful VoxCode capabilities as MCP tools (repository search, file inspection, AST analysis, dependency analysis, semantic retrieval, build, test, verification).
- Do NOT create large MCP server ecosystems, dozens of servers, MCP microservices, or MCP-based microservices.
- Use MCP only where it provides genuine architectural value for tool interoperability.
- MCP is TIER 5 (OPTIONAL) - only implement if time remains after core Agentic AI, RAG, and Verification capabilities are complete.

### Technology Scope Protection
- **EXCLUDED:** Kafka, Kubernetes, Redis, Microservices, Distributed service architecture, Complex caching, Complex messaging infrastructure, Custom distributed workflow engines, Huge MCP ecosystem, Multi-agent swarm architecture, Foundation-model training, Custom LLM, Generic multi-language support, Full IDE replacement, Unlimited autonomous coding, Complex voice infrastructure, Arbitrary feature generation.
- **Database Constraint:** MySQL/JPA/Hibernate are supporting infrastructure for Agentic AI state persistence. No complex database optimization, advanced SQL engineering, database sharding, complicated caching architecture, or unnecessary database abstractions.
- **MCP Constraint:** MCP is a focused tool interface for interoperability. Do NOT create multiple MCP servers, MCP microservices, dozens of MCP tools, or an MCP ecosystem. Use MCP only where it provides genuine architectural value for tool interoperability.
- **Every technology must have a direct role in:** Retrieve → Investigate → Decide → Act → Verify → Evaluate.
- **Prioritize:** Completed + Reliable + Measurable + Defensible over Large + Feature-heavy + Unfinished.
- **Do not add a feature unless it strengthens:** Evidence → Decision → Action → Verification → Evaluation.

### Evaluation
- Continuous focus on proving the value of RAG and the Agent via ablation and benchmarking. Separate investigation metrics from remediation metrics.
- RAG evaluation must include quantitative metrics (Recall@K, Precision@K, MRR, NDCG, retrieval relevance, latency, context relevance, token efficiency, investigation success).
- Ablation study comparing AST+Dependency Graph+Agent vs AST+Dependency Graph+RAG+Agent to demonstrate RAG's actual value.

### Intelligence Boundaries
- **AST = Structural Truth**: JavaParser provides deterministic structural analysis (classes, methods, annotations, imports).
- **JGraphT = Relationship Truth**: Dependency graph provides deterministic relationship analysis (caller/callee, class dependencies, interfaces).
- **RAG = Semantic/Contextual Information**: Hybrid retrieval provides semantic context, documentation, similar implementations, cross-file relationships.
- **Tools = Operational Truth**: Agent tools provide operational capabilities (read files, execute builds, run tests).
- **Build/Tests = Behavioral Truth**: Execution verification provides behavioral validation.
- **Critical Boundary**: RAG must NEVER replace AST or dependency analysis for structural claims. Use the right tool for the right truth.

## Cross-Cutting Requirements — Professional Git & GitHub Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

The project uses a GitFlow-inspired branching strategy:

- `main` → stable/release-ready code
- `develop` → integration branch for upcoming releases
- `feature/*` → new feature/task implementation branches
- `fix/*` → bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` → critical fixes when required

**Rule:** Do not directly develop on `main` or `develop`. All development must occur on feature/fix branches.

### Standard Developer Workflow

For every VXC task, developers must follow this workflow:

1. Start from the latest `develop` branch.
2. Pull the latest remote changes: `git pull origin develop`.
3. Create a dedicated feature/fix branch: `git checkout -b feature/VXC-XXX-description` or `git checkout -b fix/VXC-XXX-description`.
4. Implement only the assigned VXC task and its required dependencies.
5. Write/update tests for the implementation.
6. Run relevant local validation (compilation, unit tests).
7. Run `mvn clean verify` or the appropriate project validation command.
8. Review `git status` to ensure no unrelated files are staged.
9. Review `git diff` to verify changes match the task scope.
10. Ensure no secrets, `.env` files, or build artifacts are included.
11. Commit using a meaningful commit message (see Commit Requirements).
12. Push the branch to GitHub: `git push origin feature/VXC-XXX-description`.
13. Create a Pull Request targeting `develop`.
14. Allow GitHub Actions to execute CI pipeline.
15. Fix any CI failures before proceeding.
16. Review the Pull Request (self-review or peer review).
17. Merge only after all required checks pass.
18. Delete the feature branch after successful merge.

### Commit Requirements

All commits must follow professional standards:

- Commits should represent logical units of work.
- Use meaningful, descriptive commit messages.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- Do not commit `.env` files containing sensitive configuration.
- Do not commit build artifacts (e.g., `target/`, `node_modules/`, `.class` files).
- Do not commit unrelated changes.
- Keep commits reasonably focused and atomic.

**Commit Message Format Examples:**

```
feat: implement repository ingestion service
fix: prevent workspace path traversal vulnerability
test: add AST annotation analysis unit tests
docs: add ADR for sandbox verification gates
refactor: extract evidence validation logic
chore: upgrade Spring Boot to 3.2.0
```

### Pull Request Requirements

Every Pull Request must contain:

- **VXC task ID(s)** in the PR title (e.g., `VXC-010: Configuration Management and Logging`)
- **Summary of implementation** describing what was done and why
- **Tests performed** documenting test coverage and results
- **CI status** confirming all checks pass
- **Architectural considerations** noting any design decisions or patterns used
- **Known limitations** if any exist
- **Screenshots/logs** when relevant (e.g., UI changes, error handling)

**PR Title Example:**
```
VXC-010: Configuration Management and Logging
```

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown
## VXC Task(s)
- VXC-010

## Summary
Implemented Spring profiles, structured logging, global exception handling, and actuator endpoints.

## Implementation
- Added Spring profiles (local, test, prod)
- Configured Logback with structured JSON logging
- Created global exception handler with standardized API responses
- Added health check and actuator endpoints

## Tests
- Unit tests for global exception handler
- Integration tests for logging output
- Manual verification of health endpoints

## CI Status
- [x] Build passes
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration tests pass
- [x] Static analysis passes

## Architectural Considerations
Used standard Spring Boot patterns. No breaking changes to existing architecture.

## Known Limitations
None identified.
```

### Branch Protection

The following branch protection rules must be enforced:

- **Protect `main`**: No direct pushes allowed
- **Protect `develop`**: No direct pushes allowed
- **No direct pushes to protected branches**: All changes must go through PRs
- **PR required for merging**: Feature/fix branches must use Pull Requests
- **Required CI checks**: All required status checks must pass before merge
- **Do not merge failing code**: Never merge code with failing required checks

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is the project's automated CI/CD system. It validates:

- **Compilation**: Maven build succeeds
- **Unit tests**: All unit tests pass
- **Integration tests**: Integration tests with Docker containers pass
- **Static analysis**: SpotBugs, Checkstyle, or other quality gates pass
- **Quality gates**: Code coverage, security scans, and other relevant checks

**Important:** GitHub Actions does NOT replace the developer's Git workflow. Developers must run local validation before pushing. CI is a safety net, not a substitute for local testing.

### Developer vs VoxCode Responsibilities

These are two separate workflows that must not be confused:

**Developer Development Workflow:**
```
Developer → Git branch → code implementation → tests → commit → push → Pull Request → CI → review → merge
```

**VoxCode Product Workflow:**
```
User Request → Classification → Investigation → Evidence → Confirmed Finding → Engineering Plan → Human Approval → Remediation → Verification → Repair/Rollback → Engineering Report
```

- The **Developer Workflow** is how humans build and maintain the VoxCode software itself.
- The **VoxCode Product Workflow** is what the VoxCode software does for its users (analyzing and fixing their code).

These workflows are entirely separate concepts. The developer workflow ensures VoxCode is built professionally. The VoxCode product workflow ensures VoxCode provides safe, evidence-driven code remediation to its users.
